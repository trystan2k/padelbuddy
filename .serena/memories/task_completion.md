# Padel Buddy – Task Completion Checklist

When a task is completed:
1. Run `npm run test` to verify no regressions
2. Ensure code style follows project conventions (2-space indent, camelCase variables, LF line endings)
3. Commit with format: `[type]: [description]` (no task IDs unless explicitly requested)
