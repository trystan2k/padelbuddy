---

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Application States

The application has two primary states:

1. **Home Screen**
2. **Game Screen**

---

## 4. Home Screen

### 4.1 Purpose

The Home Screen is the entry point of the application. It allows the user to:

- Start a new game
- Resume an existing game (if one exists)

### 4.2 UI Elements

- **App Title / Logo** (as per design)
- **Primary Button:** "Start New Game"
- **Secondary Button:** "Resume Game" (only visible if a saved game exists)

### 4.3 Behavior

- If **no active or saved game exists**:
  - Only "Start New Game" is visible
- If a **saved game exists**:
  - Both "Start New Game" and "Resume Game" are visible

### 4.4 Actions

#### Start New Game

- Clears any existing saved game data
- Navigates to the **Game Screen** with scores reset

#### Resume Game

- Loads the last saved game state
- Navigates to the **Game Screen**

---

## 5. Game Screen

### 5.1 Purpose

The Game Screen is where all scoring interactions take place.

### 5.2 Core Concepts

#### Teams

- **Team A**
- **Team B**

#### Scoring Model (Padel)

- Game points: `0 → 15 → 30 → 40 → Game`
- Sets consist of multiple games
- Traditional scoring model is used for v1:
  - Deuce and advantage are enabled
  - A game is won after winning the advantage point
  - A set is won at 6 games with a minimum 2-game margin
  - At `6-6` games, a tie-break is played (first to 7 points, win by 2)

> Note: Tie-break behavior is fixed in v1. Tie-break configuration remains out of scope.

---

### 5.3 UI Elements

#### Score Display

- **Current Game Points**
  - Team A points
  - Team B points
- **Current Set Score**
  - Games won by Team A
  - Games won by Team B

#### Action Buttons (per team)

For **each team (A and B)**:

- **Add Point (+)**
- **Remove Point (−)**

#### Navigation

- **Back / Home Button**
  - Returns to Home Screen
  - Automatically saves current game state

---

## 6. Scoring Logic

### 6.1 Add Point

When the user taps **Add Point** for a team:

1. Increment the game score according to padel rules
2. Update UI immediately
3. Persist the new state

### 6.2 Remove Point (Undo)

When the user taps **Remove Point** for a team:

1. Decrement the game score following reverse padel rules
2. Prevent score from going below `0`
3. If undoing a completed game, restore previous game state
4. Update UI immediately
5. Persist the new state

### 6.3 Game Win

When a team wins a game:

- Increment that team’s **set games count**
- Reset both teams’ **game points to 0**

### 6.4 Set Win

When a team wins a set:

- Increment set counter (if tracked visually)
- Reset game counters
- Continue match unless user starts a new game manually

---

## 7. State Management & Persistence

### 7.1 Persisted Data

The following must be stored locally on the device:

- Team A game points
- Team B game points
- Team A games in current set
- Team B games in current set
- Match status (active / finished)
- Timestamp of last update

### 7.2 Persistence Rules

- State must be saved:
  - On every score change
  - When navigating away from Game Screen
  - When the app is backgrounded

- State must be restored:
  - On app reopen
  - On "Resume Game"

---

## 8. Navigation Flow

### 8.1 Flow Diagram (Textual)

- App Launch
  → Home Screen
    → Start New Game
      → Game Screen
    → Resume Game
      → Game Screen

- Game Screen
  → Home Button
    → Home Screen (state saved)

---

## 9. Error Handling & Edge Cases

### 9.1 Invalid Actions

- Removing points when score is already at minimum → no-op
- Multiple rapid taps → debounce to avoid double scoring

### 9.2 App Interruptions

- Incoming notifications
- Screen lock
- App backgrounding

Expected behavior:

- No data loss
- Resume exactly where the user left off

---

## 10. Performance Requirements

- UI updates must occur within **100ms**
- No visible lag when tapping buttons
- Minimal memory footprint

---

## 11. Accessibility & Usability

- Large touch targets suitable for sports usage
- High contrast for outdoor visibility
- Minimal text, icon-first interaction

---

## 12. Non-Goals (Out of Scope – v1)

- Player names
- Match history
- Tie-break configuration
- Cloud sync
- Companion phone app integration

---

## 13. Future Enhancements

- Tie-break configuration options (e.g., super tie-break)
- Match history
- Haptic feedback on score change
- Voice input (if supported by Zepp OS)
- Companion mobile app

---

## 14. Open Questions

- Maximum number of sets per match
- Whether to support doubles player names

### 14.1 Resolved Clarifications

- v1 scoring rules are fixed to traditional padel/tennis scoring (deuce/advantage + tie-break at `6-6`).
- Engineering implementation approach for scoring logic is **Option 2**: state machine with transition history for deterministic undo.

---

## 15. Acceptance Criteria

- User can start a new game
- User can resume a previous game
- User can add/remove points for either team
- User can view current game and set scores
- Game state persists across app restarts
